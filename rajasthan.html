  <h3>Itinerary</h3>
  <p><b>Day 1: Arrive in Udaipur – Mount Abu</b></p>

Arrival at Udaipur and transfer to Mount Abu for overnight stay. Sightseeing of Mount Abu – Dilwara Temples: This temple complex built in the Solanki style of architecture dates back to the 11th and 13th centuries AD. Carved out of white marble, these temples are dedicated to the Jain Tirthankars (enlightened souls). The oldest temple, the Vimal Vasahi temple, was built in 1031 AD and is dedicated to the first of the Jain Tirthankars. The temples are very famous for the intricate carvings, especially on the pillars. But the most striking feature of this Jain temple is the marble pendant in the dome of the porch. It hangs from the ceiling like an enchanting cluster of half-open lotuses with cups so finely carved that they appear to be transparent. Overnight stay in Mount Abu.
